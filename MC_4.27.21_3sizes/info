2 templates that contain 3 different sized calcs. 
The purpose of this is to make the clusters more realistic with increased calc size diversity and to determine how this addition impacts classification difficulty.
These templates will have more accurate larger calc distribution due to improved methodology.
Both templates contain 5 clusters spaced by 35mm using HA 1.9 density calcs.
10mm, 150-180: 7, 180-212: 2, 212-250: 2
20mm, 150-180: 18, 180-212: 2, 212-250: 2
