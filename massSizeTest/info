massSizeTestHeteroPhantom_1683x2367x571.raw is a heterogeneous phantom showcasing 4 different spiculated masses with base diameters of 5mm, 6mm, 7mm, and 8mm.

There are 12 total masses arranged in a 3x4 array with there being 3 of each mass per row. 3 of each mass is included so that we can vary the output levels of
the 1/3 KI 300mg/ml + 2/3 cyan dye when we print the slices containing the mass in order to create a classification task with an adequate difficulty.
