massSizeTestHeteroPhantom_1683x2367x571.raw is a heterogeneous phantom showcasing 4 different spiculated masses with base diameters of 5mm, 6mm, 7mm, and 8mm. 

There are 12 total masses arranged in a 3x4 array with each row containing 3 of the same mass. The same mass is included so that we can vary the output percent 
of the 1/3 KI 300mg/ml + 2/3 cyan dye to 100%, 90%, and 80%. This will allow us to determine which output level and size provide the most suitable difficulty 
for a classification task.
