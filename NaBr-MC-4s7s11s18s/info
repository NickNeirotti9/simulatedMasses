4 templates created with different amounts of small (150-180) calcs and 3 larger calcs (212-250). 
The purpose of this was to determine if a reader study comparing 10mm vs 20mm clusters would be challenging 
enough and what amount of smaller calcs serves as the most difficult comparison. 
All of these templates contain 5 clusters spaced by 35mm using HA 1.9 density calcs.

10mm(4sm), 150-180: 4, 212-250: 3
10mm(7sm), 150-180: 7, 212-250: 3
20mm(11sm), 150-180: 11, 212-250: 3
20mm(18sm), 150-180:18, 212-250: 3
